# * Feburary 13th 2026 Update:
Howdy!, yes im using a read me section as a blog update whatcha gonna do about it. As stated below in the **"Why are you thinking of redoing the entire website"**, I plan to remake the website. I just tried seeing what [Astro.build](https://astro.build) is and safe to say I'm probably never going to be using a single web framework ever again because WHAT THE FFFFFFFFFFF-<br> <br>So now I have 2 choices, redo the website as a static website and see alot of tutorials either from W3 or YouTube. Or I could further indulge into Astro, see how it works and decent into madness. Anywho, thats it for the update!
<br> ~~yes i've done nothing for the website these past 3 months.~~

Welcome!
my website is currently under process as well as the entire thing cuz i have no fucking idea what im doing lmao
# I see a 404 Page. What does that mean?
If you get something like this, it's intentional. I don't have a proper landing page made up at the moment, so I made this instead while I'm working on the landing page.

# TO-DO 
◼️ Add a "Social" Page/Icons <br>
◼️ Add a "FAQ" (why, because uhhhhhhhhhhh.... meow :3 ) <br>
◼️ Add a "Specs" section <br>	
◼️ REDO THE ENTIRE FUCKING WEBSITE AAAAA- (probably so that the links smoothly transforms the page instead of loading a new website everytime) <br>
◼️ Mobile Optimization (will happen after i'm done with the majority of the website, probably either when im done adding stuff or if i redid the website) <br>
◼️ Discord Server????? <br>
◼️ Contact email and section (honestly idk if i should make a whole new account for it or use my second account for it lol) 

# Why doesn't the music start?<br>
I disabled the autoplay as some people may not like it automatically starting, I might find how I can make it so that the user chooses to make it autoplay or not but I think thats too much for just a portfolio lol.

# Why are you thinking of redoing the entire website?
I feel like it's a bit wonky for the websites to move from one place to another and I want to add like cool transitional animations to it. Oh yea, I uh tend to not work on the website for a huge interval of time, and I do not understand what the fuck is going on when I come back lol.
