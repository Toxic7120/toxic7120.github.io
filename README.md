# I see a 404 Page. What does that mean?
If you get something like this, it's intentional. I don't have a proper landing page made up at the moment, so I made this instead while I'm working on the landing page.

# Why does the music stop upon refresh?
That's because browsers based on Chromium have a tendency to automatically pause any audio or video that isn't muted upon refresh, Now at the time of writing the update message I don't know how I can add a custom image button (JS is hard lol). I'll leave the in-built controls as is. (Huge props to [Matt's Tech](https://youtube.com/@mattstech?si=5g8nv3ZzPFhlGImb) for letting me know :3)
